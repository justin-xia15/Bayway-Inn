# Bayway-Inn
A landing page for a fictional hotel called Bayway Inn. Mobile first design. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project was to refine my front-end development skills. More specifically, I wanted to practice creating a responsive website without using a framework such as Bootstrap. jQuery was used for the slideUp() and slideDown() methods.

## Room for improvement
One aspect of this project that could be improved is the code. I feel that by making my code more short and concise, it would be easier to understand for both myself and others. If I were to work on this project again, I would want to use CSS Grid to create the layout of the website. This would help reduce the amount of code as you can make the website responsive without using media queries.
